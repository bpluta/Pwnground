For example if some program expects input up to 10 bytes and does not check how many bytes users are trying to put they may be able to put more and overflow data beyond the allocated 10 byte long buffer.\n\nIn some cases this behavior can be exploited to do things that is was not intended to do.

Stack is responsible for the correct execution flow of called functions so each thread needs to have their own even if threads share other memory with each other.\n\nOne of the most crucial elements regarding to a stack is a stack pointer which stores address of its current topmost element. The proper usage of the stack is to \"push\" and \"pop\" elements on it with last-in, first-out order by incrementing or decrementing the stack pointer and moving elements to a stack pointer related place in memory."

When program needs to execute other code than the one that it has in the next place in memory it uses one of branching instructions and simply \"jumps\" to a place in the memory where the code is. In order to make this procedure stable and deterministic when dealing with code of high level functions and methods there is a special convention to deal with function calls.\n\nOn 64-bit ARM Apple platforms function right after jumping to its code puts both frame pointer and function return address onto a stack and after that it overwrites frame pointer with value from stack pointer. The next step is allocating space for local variables by adding necessary size value to the stack pointer (aligned to 16 bytes) to make dedicated space for them. After that, function body instructions are executed and finally the frame pointer and return address are restored back from the stack, the stack pointer is decremented by the initially incremented size value and function jumps back to the address of the return address."

Due to the performance they are used as first-in-line storage for the instructions. For instance, registers keep the value of current instruction pointer which determines from what address next instruction should be fetched and executed, values of current stack pointer, flags, immediate storage for value transfer between two places in memory and many more.\n\nOn ARM64 architecture, the most important 64-bit registers are **SP** (stack pointer), **XZR** (read-only register storing 0 as value) and **X0-X30** general purpose registers for universal usage. On Apple platforms there is additional standard which applies to general purpose registers - **X0** stores returned value, **X16** stores syscall value, **X29** stores preserved frame pointer and **X30** stores preserved return address from an executed function.
